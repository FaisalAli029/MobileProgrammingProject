### _Changes Since the Design Document:_

  - Add an Icon and a launch screen to make the app more Appling.
  - Changed the reminder feature from its own page to it being implemented in the services screen.
  - Changed table view cell color to white because the of UI problems with the edit feature in the table view controller.
  - Not implementing a system alert due to the belief that the UX experience will degrade.
